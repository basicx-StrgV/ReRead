## What is ReRead
ReRead is a small console program that can make code files, that are hard to read (e.g. one line .js files), more readable.

## How to use
When the program is first started, it will create a **ReRead** folder, that contains an **Input**, **Output** and **Log** folder.

Put the files that you want to use in the **Input** directory.

ReRead will show you a list of every file in the **Input** directory.
Then you just need to select the file that you want.

When the program shows **DONE** your new file can be found in the **Output** directory.
